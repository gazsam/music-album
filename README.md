<h1>   - Spring Boot / Spring Data JPA / Thymeleaf demo </h1>

The following demo shows how to bind to a MYSQL service from a data bound Spring Boot [Spring Data JPA]. 
This ensures you don't have to write any code to retrieve the bound data source connection details as 
spring auto configures this for you using spring cloud service connector library.

```

<h2> Deploy to   </h2>

- When deploying to   you must bind the app to a MYSQL service as shown in the manifest.yml below.

```
applications:
- name: pas-albums
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  host: pas-albums
  domain: mybluemix.net
  path: ./target/SpringBootJPA-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
  services:
    - pas-mysql
```

Note: The manifest file below assumes you have a MYSQL service named "pas-mysql"
